                <div class="about-me">
                    <p>While I was in the Army in the early 2000's, I spent my spare time teaching myself HTML for fun. Over
                        the course of the next several years, that learning blossomed into CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p> I used that knowledge to manage a wonderful team of people to reface the website of a non-profit
                        organization, and being around them made me want to start pursing web development as a career. I
                        wanted to take my passion to the next level with Front End Development as my focus, but with Back
                        End management in mind, so I joined up with the Thinkful Full Stack bootcamp to bolster my skill
                        set.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also spend a lot of time on YouTube and Reddit keeping up with new front end and UX/UI techniques
                        and often work through classes on Udemy and StackSkills, as well as other learning sites.</p>
                    <p>I currently am specifically looking to work on a team of talented, imaginative programmers.</p>
                    <p>I've always been interested in financial markets and recently I have been learning about blockchain,
                        cryptocurrency trading, and options trading and have been working on a few side projects to build
                        web tools that can help people (and myself!) learn about and/or trade effectively and intelligently
                        in these environments.</p>

                    <p>My other love is science, and to that effect I recieved a B.S. in Biological Sciences from University
                        of Texas at Arlington. I hope to use the knowledge I gained there as I begin to learn and develop
                        sophisticated Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications.</p>
                    <p>Outside of web coding, I enjoy my yearly camping trip, teaching others how to code, discovering new
                        music, and working on writing a novel one day.</p>
                    <p>My hilarious little pug, Saki, is my coding co-pilot.</p>
